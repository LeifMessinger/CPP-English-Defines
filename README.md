# CPP-English-Defines
Hate syntax? Love grammar? This is for you!

## How to build:
Run `make`

Run `make test` to test if it worked. It should print `The absolute value of -1 is 1`

## Documentation
If you can't read this code, you need to go back to first grade.

Read through the all the defines in the headers.

Read `test.cpp` to see how it comes together.

## How to use

Edit `test.cpp` to play around first.

Write your own program using the `english_compiled.h` header

Copy `english_compiled.h` to your own project's folder to use it in your own projects. You can rename it to something else, like `english.h` if you want.
